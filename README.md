# 🚀 A Machine Learning Based Job Matching and Skill Gap Detection System

This project presents an intelligent, data-driven system designed to align job seekers’ current skills with market demands using advanced machine learning models. It helps users identify suitable job roles, evaluate skill gaps, and provides a roadmap for upskilling — enhancing career growth and employability.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

With the rise of automation and evolving tech landscapes, there exists a growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the requirements of modern IT roles. This system addresses the problem by:

- Predicting job roles using classification algorithms.
- Detecting skill gaps for desired job roles.
- Recommending targeted upskilling paths.
- Empowering users with data-driven career guidance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Recommend relevant job roles based on users' existing skills.
- ✅ Identify missing skills by comparing profiles with job market expectations.
- ✅ Suggest a personalized career roadmap.
- ✅ Visualize model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

---
